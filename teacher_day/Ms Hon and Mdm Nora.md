###### **Hi all I am creating a story to thank Ms Hon and Mdm Nora!**
#### **One day, when Ms Hon was teaching, she was interupted by the sound of the national song bell with the announcer voice signalling the start of the time to be ready.**
### *Unfortunately, Ms Hon's computer's battery was very low and was about to shut down. She had already informed us that we had to be quick in copying the chinese work answers to prevent such a thing to happening.*
